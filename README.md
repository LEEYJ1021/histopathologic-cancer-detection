# Histopathologic Cancer Detection Project Report

---

## 1. Problem and Data Description (5 points)

**Problem Definition:**  
This project addresses a binary classification task: predicting the presence of metastatic cancer in small histopathologic image patches. Automating this diagnostic process can assist pathologists, reduce workload, and accelerate cancer detection.  

**Data Description:**  
- The dataset consists of **220,025 training images** and **57,458 test images**.  
- Each image is a **96×96 pixel TIFF file**.  
- Labels are provided in `train_labels.csv`:
  - **1** → Cancer present  
  - **0** → No cancer  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) confirmed that the class distribution is fairly balanced, minimizing concerns about severe class imbalance.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (15 points)

**Label Distribution:**  
A bar plot of label counts in the training subset shows both classes (Cancer and No Cancer) are well represented, ensuring balanced training data.

**Sample Images:**  
Representative samples from both classes were displayed:  
- Cancer tissue patches show dense, irregular nuclei.  
- Non-cancer tissue patches also contain nuclei but appear more structured.  

**Observation:**  
It is challenging to distinguish classes by eye, highlighting the need for **deep learning models** like CNNs that can learn subtle and complex spatial features.  

**Analysis Plan:**  
Since the dataset is large (~7.76 GB), we avoided loading all images into memory. Instead, we used `ImageDataGenerator` to efficiently load and preprocess data in batches.

## 3. Model Architecture (25 points)

**Choice of Architecture:**  
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was implemented due to its strength in capturing spatial patterns and textures in images.  

**Architecture Details:**  
- Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling.  
- Flattening followed by a fully connected dense layer (128 units).  
- Batch Normalization to stabilize learning.  
- Dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting.  
- Final dense output layer with a **sigmoid activation** for binary classification.  

**Compilation:**  
- **Optimizer:** Adam (`learning_rate=0.001`)  
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy  

**Potential Improvements:**  
- Deeper CNNs or pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for transfer learning.  
- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, dropout ratio).  
- Incorporating advanced data augmentation techniques.

## 4. Results and Analysis (35 points)

**Training Results (Fast Version):**  
- **Epochs:** 1  
- **Steps per epoch:** 50 (subset for speed)  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~68%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~59%  
- **Validation Loss:** ~1.78  

**Analysis:**  
- The gap between training and validation accuracy suggests **early overfitting**.  
- Limited epochs and data usage restricted performance.  
- Adding regularization and data augmentation could improve generalization.  
- Using more epochs and the full dataset would likely boost accuracy significantly.  

**Suggested Enhancements:**  
- Apply **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting.  
- Use **ReduceLROnPlateau** to adjust learning rate when validation performance stalls.  
- Augment data with rotations, flips, and zooms to improve robustness.

## 5. Conclusion (15 points)

**Summary of Results:**  
- A simple CNN was built and trained on a small subset of the dataset.  
- The model achieved ~68% training accuracy but struggled to generalize (~59% validation accuracy).  
- These results highlight the importance of longer training, more data, and model improvements.  

**Key Learnings:**  
- **Batch Normalization** stabilized training.  
- **Dropout** helped reduce overfitting, but further tuning is needed.  
- Increasing model complexity without regularization may worsen overfitting.  

**Future Work:**  
- Train with **more data** and **longer epochs**.  
- Experiment with **transfer learning** using pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).  
- Apply **advanced augmentation** techniques to simulate variability.  
- Explore **ensemble models** to combine predictions and boost accuracy.
